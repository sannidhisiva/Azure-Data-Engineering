**Azure SQL Data Warehouse**

The capabilities associated with Azure SQL Data Warehouse are now a feature of Azure Synapse Analytics called dedicated SQL pool.Existing Azure SQL Data Warehouse customers can continue running their existing Azure SQL Data Warehouse workloads using the dedicated SQL pool feature in Azure Synapse Analytics without going through any changes. Customers can also start managing their existing warehouse data with Azure Synapse Analytics to take advantage of advanced analytics features like serverless data lake exploration and integrated SQL and Apache Sparkâ„¢ engines
